# Vaadin IntelliJ Plugin

Official Vaadin plugin for JetBrains IntelliJ, currently featuring undo support for Vaadin Copilot modifications.

This plugin integrates directly with IntelliJâ€™s undo stack, allowing developers to easily reverse changes made by Vaadin Copilot.

While initially focused on enhancing undo functionality, the plugin is designed for future expansion with additional features to streamline your Vaadin development workflow.
