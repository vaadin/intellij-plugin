## Coverage Statistics
- **Total new test files**: 13 (vs 1 existing disabled test)
- **Total lines of test code**: 1,329 lines
- **Handler coverage**: 9 out of 19 handlers tested (47% handler coverage)
- **Test types**: Unit tests with mocking for platform-independent testing

## Test Features
- Uses JUnit 5 and Mockito for comprehensive testing
- Platform-independent unit tests that don't require full IntelliJ environment
- Comprehensive coverage of constructor behavior, response structures, and edge cases
- Tests for both success and failure scenarios
- Validation of data extraction and response formatting

## Build Configuration Updates
- Added Mockito dependencies for enhanced testing capabilities
- Maintained compatibility with existing build system

## Testing Strategy
The tests are designed to:
1. Validate handler behavior without requiring full IntelliJ Platform setup
2. Test critical business logic and data transformations
3. Ensure proper error handling and edge case management
4. Verify response structures and status codes
5. Test project creation workflow components

This significantly increases the test coverage for the Vaadin IntelliJ Plugin, particularly focusing on the command handlers and project creation features as requested.
